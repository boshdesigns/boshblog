I love messing around with Terminal ever since I started to learn that Front End Developer could be done through it (I didn't really have much use for it before).

I think I like it so much because it feels like I'm within the Matrix... bit sad I know but I don't care.

What makes me like it so much are the other things you can do with Terminal.

**Ping Command**

I used to use ping.eu if I ever needed to ping a URL. But I found myself using Terminal more for quickly pinging.

```
$ ping www.google.com
```

**Say Hello Terminal**

If you want your Mac to say something out loud, you can use the “say” command, followed by whatever it is you want your Mac to say. Here’s an example:

```
$ say "hello"
```

**Speak up Thomas**

In addition, there are many different voices in which terminal can say what you pass in.

```
$ say --voice Thomas "Bonjour je m'appelle Valère"
```


**Keep Your Mac From Falling Asleep**

Terminal comes with a way to keep your Mac from falling asleep, dimming the display, or showing the screensaver. Simply use the following command:

```
$ caffeinate
```


**Clear the Back Scroll**

You can quickly clear the back scroll within Terminal by simply pushing CMD + K.

**Calendar**

You can view the current month's calendar by running:

```
$ cal
```

You can also pass different arguments after to display other months and years.

Display the whole year:

```
$ cal 2017
```

Display just November 1955 (if you know why this date your good in my books):

```
$ cal 11 1955
```

These are a few I use/played around with. Theres plenty more things to do though.
