Why hello there.
As this is my first post let me tell you a couple of things about myself to kick it off.

I've been a front end developer (well a proper one anyway) for about 3 years now. I've done a little bit of most things to be fair, but seem to have settled into my current job working mainly with Drupal. For about 2 years now I've been working for an automotive website provider, building websites in Drupal for used car dealers.

Whilst Drupal can be a harsh mistress I do enjoy building with it.

I do build/mess around with Drupal in my spare time, I try my best to mess around with other things at home and leave Drupal developing at work.

Which is why I'm doing this blog.
I wanted to give a static site generator ago and thought Hugo would be perfect thing to tickle.

At the moment I've set up this quick blog using the very nice Casper theme from Valere JEANTET. It's a lovely theme, one I kind of want to destroy (in a nice way) to learn GoLang and hopefully build my own theme. So that's the plan anyway. I'm going to blog about what I learn along the way of customising this theme and building my own. I will also be blogging about any other front end nuggets I find out about or use, including Drupal. So stay tuned.

Well thats it for this post.

If all goes well then there should be more posts coming.
